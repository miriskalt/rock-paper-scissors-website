# HTML, CSS & JS Website

This repository will contain the variouse try and error projects along the way of learning webdevelopment.

## rps
This project was built in the isolation during the COVID-19 crisis. It was the first deployed website.
In order to pass time, when home alone for a very long period of time, I needed a opponent of Rock, Paper & Scissors.
And it so happend, that this would serve greate as a website, so the application could be shared with friends and family.

##### List of Open Points:
The images are sourrounded by a border. This container has a mapping and a padding. One of the values is a little of, causing the images to be
be uncentered. Furthermore the css class attribute display: inline-box (o.Ã¤.) did not work. Therefore the implementation with the floats was
presented as a solution according to different forums. This  approch worked okay. But under certain circumstances the action images can be offcentered.
I appologize for this inconvenience.
